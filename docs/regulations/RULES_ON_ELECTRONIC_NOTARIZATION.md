# RULES ON ELECTRONIC NOTARIZATION

# RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, in 2020, the government implemented and enforced strict community quarantine measures in various localities in the Philippines on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, drastically limiting mobility and creating immense challenges in carrying out notarial acts in accordance with the "2004 Rules on Notarial Practice" (2004 Notarial Rules), which require individuals to appear in person before a notary public;

WHEREAS, in response to urgent requests from the legal community in the context of the pandemic, the Court formulated and issued the "2020 Interim Rules on Remote Notarization of Paper Documents" (RON Rules), which was primarily intended as a stopgap measure, balancing the need to retain security measures under the 2004 Notarial Rules to ensure legal acceptability while ensuring that notarization of paper documents could be accomplished remotely while the locality remained under community quarantine;

WHEREAS, mindful of the growing trend toward digitalization and remote processes as well as the many shortcomings of the traditional mode of notarization of paper documents under the 2004 Notarial Rules, the Supreme Court created a technical working group (TWG) to formulate rules on electronic notarial practice to determine the minimum functional specifications for the necessary technology and to identify the most cost-efficient information technology infrastructure necessary for the envisioned electronic notarial system. The TWG was spearheaded by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa as chairperson and composed of Associate Justice Ramon Paul L. Hernando as vice-chairperson, and the court administrator, representatives from the Office of the Chief Justice, Court of Appeals, Court Management Office, Office of the Bar Confidant, Office of

the Chief Attorney, Management Information Systems Office, and executive judges as members.

WHEREAS, in January 2021, although still restricted by the health protocols in place on account of the pandemic, the TWG began the comprehensive process of drafting the rules on electronic notarization based on a draft 2004 Proposed Rules on Electronic Notarial Practice prepared by the Court's Subcommittee on E-Commerce under the leadership of then Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno, as well as the proposal from the U.P. Women's Lawyer Circle;

WHEREAS, equipped with learnings and the feedback from various trial courts nationwide on the implementation of the RON Rules, the TWG finished drafting the initial version of the "Rules on Electronic Notarization" (Rules) on November 8, 2021;

WHEREAS, despite being faced with several possible alternatives to pursue, the TWG deliberately proposed the adoption of rules on electronic notarization that will supplement, rather than replace, the 2004 Notarial Rules in order to address the pressing need to introduce major changes in the area of notarization while still guaranteeing the unimpeded flow of legal affairs and continuously allowing individuals to have legal instruments notarized on a day-to-day basis;

WHEREAS, after several internal discussions to ensure ease of adoption of electronic notarization in the country, several changes were made in the second version of the Rules drafted by the TWG on March 16, 2022;

WHEREAS, with the goal of further enhancing the utility of the Rules and guided by the concept of innovation—one of the key outcomes identified in the Supreme Court's Strategic Plan for Judicial Innovations 2022-2027—the TWG identified the territorial jurisdiction of notaries public as a key area for change and extensively examined the history of the law and rules governing the jurisdiction of notaries public to explore the possibility of expanding the jurisdiction of electronic notaries public to cater to the needs of individuals in remote areas of the Philippines and those abroad, and its efforts eventually came to fruition in the third version of the Rules on March 10, 2023;

WHEREAS, impelled by the need to incorporate the best practices on electronic notarization, the TWG surveyed and studied the best practices on electronic notarization in various jurisdictions, including the United States of America (U.S.A.), Australia, Indonesia, Japan, and South Korea;

WHEREAS, having determined that the U.S.A. has the most compatible and comprehensive electronic notarial framework, members of the TWG, together with the members of the secretariat, met with an American law

firm on May 23, 2023 to discuss its experiences, best practices, and challenges on electronic notarization and with an office of the Secretary of State, the implementor of the rules on electronic notarization in one of the American states, on May 30, 2023;

WHEREAS, having learned from our American counterparts that one of the challenges they faced in implementing their rules on electronic notarization is the recognition of electronic documents in transactions involving conveyances of real property, Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa and members of the secretariat also met with representatives from the Land Registration Authority to inquire on whether the registries of deeds would honor electronically notarized documents and to discuss the technologies needed for the authentication and recognition of these documents;

WHEREAS, to balance the protection of public interest with the promotion of continuous innovation driven by free competition among solutions providers, the TWG decided to employ a system of accreditation of service providers instead of procuring and developing a singular electronic notarization facility, which would have caused further delay in digitalization because it would have required a considerable amount of time and resources to develop before being offered to the public;

WHEREAS, to ensure that the current available technology would support the envisioned electronic notarization framework and that the chosen technology would be dependable and could securely handle the transactions, maintain the integrity of notarial acts, and provide reliable verification and authentication mechanisms, the TWG held consultative meetings on April 12, April 26, May 10, and May 11, 2023 with several solutions providers that initiated contact with the Supreme Court regarding their respective proposals to digitize the notarial process;

WHEREAS, armed with information gathered from the meetings with representatives from foreign jurisdictions, solutions providers, and other stakeholders and after a series of consultations among its members, the TWG introduced important changes, which resulted in the fourth draft of the Rules and the initial draft of the "Guidelines on the Accreditation of Electronic Notarization Facility Providers" (Guidelines) on October 13, 2023;

WHEREAS, considering the invaluable insights continually being provided by the solutions providers for the TWG's improvement of the existing draft Rules, the TWG decided to furnish the solutions providers with the fourth draft of the Rules and solicited their comments thereon, especially with regard to the feasibility of its implementation and the ease of providing facilities for electronic notarization to the public from their perspective;

WHEREAS, after incorporating the comments of the solutions providers, the TWG held meetings on February 14 and 28, 2024 to resolve any pending issues and to further refine the Rules and the Guidelines;

WHEREAS, with more solutions providers offering their expertise and proposals to modernize the area of notarization and to gain insight on what areas still needed to be improved upon in the draft Rules, the TWG conducted another round of consultative meetings on March 22, March 26, May 23, and June 4, 2024;

WHEREAS, the TWG requested for a meeting with the Department of Foreign Affairs on November 22, 2024 to understand any challenges in the implementation of the draft Rules and thereafter relayed the possible logistical limitations and concerns in other countries to the Court En Banc;

WHEREAS, fully aware of the possible challenges in the implementation of electronic notarization in other countries, the Court En Banc nevertheless determined that it was best to retain the current provisions allowing the expanded jurisdiction of electronic notaries public if only to remove one more hindrance to the unhampered implementation of the Rules worldwide and to affirm the Court's commitment in recognizing as valid all instruments that are electronically notarized in accordance with the same;

WHEREAS, after carefully considering and incorporating the additional insights and comments generously provided by the Members of the Court En Banc, the TWG crafted the final drafts of the Rules and the Guidelines;

NOW, THEREFORE, acting on the recommendation of Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa, chairperson of the Subcommittee on the Revision of Rules Governing Notaries Public, the Court, sitting en banc, resolved to APPROVE the "Rules on Electronic Notarization" and the "Guidelines on the Accreditation of Electronic Notarization Facility Providers", copies of which are attached hereto and made an integral part hereof.

No application shall be processed without the payment of the required fee. Should the provider subsequently withdraw the application before the same is approved/renewed, the fee shall be deemed forfeited.

Section 4. Performance Bond. — Within five days from the notice of approval, the successful ENF Provider shall deposit cash amounting to PHP 100,000.00 with the Supreme Court Cashier under the fiduciary account with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) in the name of the ENA. The Certificate shall not be released until the posting of the bond.

The cash deposit shall answer for any monetary penalty that may be imposed by the Court on the Accredited Provider upon due investigation. Should the cash bond be reduced due to the imposition of any penalty, the Accredited Provider shall replenish the same within 15 days from notice.

Section 5. Period of Validity of Accreditation. The Certificate shall be valid for three years from the date of approval of the application or until revoked.

Section 6. Renewal of Accreditation. — The qualifications under Section 1, Rule III of the Guidelines shall also be required for the renewal of accreditation of Accredited Providers.

The Accredited Providers shall also pay a renewal fee of PHP 5,000.00. No application for renewal shall be processed without the payment of the required fee.

Section 7. Pre-termination or Non-Renewal of Accreditation. — If the Accredited Provider chooses to pre-terminate or choose not to renew their accreditation, they shall first give notice to their enrolled ENPs at least one month prior to filing a letter-request to the ENA.

The Accredited Provider is mandated to ensure the receipt of notice by all their enrolled ENPs and, upon the latter's request, assist in the transition to another Accredited Provider with respect to the migration of electronic documents, Electronic Notarial Books, any video recordings, and other relevant data. In no case shall the terminating or non-renewing ENF Provider keep, make a copy, transfer, or use in any manner for themselves or any person

The letter-request to the ENA shall be accompanied by a list of names of all enrolled ENPs and proof of receipt of notice.

Upon submission of the requirements, the ENA shall issue in favor of the Accredited Provider an authority to withdraw their outstanding cash deposit from the Supreme Court Cashier, which, in turn, shall prepare the necessary voucher for the withdrawal of the fund from the LBP.

Section 9. Grounds for Revocation of Accreditation. — The Court, through the ENA, may motu proprio revoke the accreditation if the Accredited Provider ceases to possess any of the requirements for accreditation.

(a) commits any misrepresentation in the application form and supporting documents;  
(b) perpetuates or participates in fraudulent acts relative to the service, as may be determined by the ENA;
